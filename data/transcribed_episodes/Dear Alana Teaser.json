{"episode_name": "Dear Alana Teaser", "episode_transcription": " This was, I was telling you about this, that I found this on her keyboard. It was just, like, kind of showed up and... I don't know, do you want me to read it to you? Dear Alana, you are just a little girl, but you really don't like yourself. What if I told you that I love who you are? I love you how you are and how you will be tomorrow. You have beautiful hair and a beautiful face, and your family would miss you if you were gone. Dear Alana, I don't know what to say. I don't know... I don't know what drove you to hurt yourself so badly. You were all alone. Why were you all alone? I know you don't understand how you can be loved or redeemed. I wish you could see that the people that love you, the people that matter, they don't hold you to those standards. They don't see you as defiled. They don't see you as someone that needs to be fixed or different than who you are. The people that love you are still with you. Those other people that left, that walked away, that couldn't follow you, they couldn't handle your light, they couldn't handle the shock, the surprise. You were too weak to see you for who you really are. But your mother, your real mother, and your real father, and your brother and sisters, they have walked with you. They see you, and now I see you, and I love you so much. From Tenderfoot TV, I'm Simon Kent-Fung. And this is Dear Alana.
